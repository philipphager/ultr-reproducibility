# ULTR Reproducibility [WIP name]
Reproducing the Baidu ULTR experiments in Jax.

## WIP: Installation
* If [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/) is available, you can install all dependencies by running: `poetry install`.
* If Conda or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) is available, you can use `mamba env create --file environment.yaml` which supports CUDA 11.8.
